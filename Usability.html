   <h2>Web Accessibility and Usability</h2>
     <h3>Multimedia</h3>
       <p>Alternative text is available on every photo so users with vision impairments or users with text-only browsers are able to access the information. Transcription of audio is provided for hearing-impaired users to understand the information in the audio. Description of videos is provided on this page as well for users who cannot load/display the video.</p>
     <h3>Site Navigation and JavaScript</h3>
       <p>Site navigation is fairly simple. The navigation bar at the top uses simple text as links so all users can access the pages. Also, I did not utilize a hover color, but instead just changed the opacity to include any colorblind users. Colors used for navigation are contrasted and passed the AA and AAA standards. All interactive links or clicks are easily identifiable. The only JavaScript used on this website is on the Education page where there is a clickable button. The button is in white and black so all users can interact with it.</p>
     <h3>Links</h3>
       <p>All links on this website open in one window when selected. No new tabs will open so the back button in all browsers will work. All external links to social media pages and pdf files are all checked periodically to ensure they are not broken. Please let me know in the contact me form located on the "Contact Me" page if links are not working properly.</p>
     <h3>Document Structure</h3>
       <p>The structure throughout this site was designed with uniformity in mind. A navigation bar is located on every page to make the website as accessible as possible. Recurring elements like text colors, text size, and headings are all uniform in order to communicate content clearly. The code of each page follows a hierarchy to keep information concise. All headings are at the top of the page with content to follow.</p>
     <h3>Text Size</h3>
       <p>The text can be made larger for people with any vision impairments. Most browsers have a feature or you can zoom in using key commands on most computers.</p>
    <h3>Browser Compatibility</h3>
       <p>This website uses HTML5 and CSS layout which is compatible in mainstream browsers such as Chrome, Internet Explorer, Safari and Firefox. The site has been tested in all major browsers to ensure maximum usability. Some browsers do not support all HTML5 elements and some do not support CSS. For browsers that do not support CSS a less complex style sheet is used automatically.</p>
