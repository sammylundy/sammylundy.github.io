<h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I'm originally from St. Petersburg, FL and I moved to Fort Myers in Fall 2017 for college. I'm currently a sophmore at Florida Gulf Coast University studying math. I hope to one day use my degree to become an actuary. In fall 2017, I was accepted into the Honors College at FGCU and have had much involvement within it. I went to many events for the honors college and took leadership courses to enrichen my skills. 
 <p>My involvement on campus includes being a member of Kappa Delta Sorority and a member of the mental health awareness club Breathe. Kappa Delta provides me with opportuities to volunteer within my community. We work hands on to mentor the Girl Scouts of America and fundraise for the PCAA. </p>
<p>In my free time, I like to hike, camp, practice yoga and spend time outdoors. I love camping and backpacking. I hope to hike the Appalachin Trail one day. My favorite campsite is Pisgah National Forest.</p>
