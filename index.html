<h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I'm originally from St. Petersburg, FL and I moved to Fort Myers in Fall 2017 for college. I'm currently a sophomore at Florida Gulf Coast University pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Mathematics with a minor in Computer Science. I hope to one day use my degree to help develop and design websites. I'm very interested in responsive web design. In fall 2017, I was accepted into the Honors College at FGCU and the resources its provided me with help me strive for success in my coursework.  
 <p>My involvement on campus includes being a member of Kappa Delta Sorority and a member of the mental health awareness club Breathe. Kappa Delta provides me with opportunities to volunteer within my community. We work for hands-on to mentor the Girl Scouts of America and fundraise for the PCAA. </p>
<p>In my free time, I like to hike, camp, practice yoga and spend time outdoors. I love camping and backpacking. I hope to hike the Appalachin Trail one day. My favorite campsite is Pisgah National Forest and Desoto Falls. My other goal is to become a certified yoga teacher with hope of becoming a teacher somehwere in my community.</p>
